The vulnerability of networks to the spread of viruses has been painfully illustrated and manifested several times in recent years. Computer
viruses and ransomware, such as WannaCry and NotPetya, autonomously spreading across the internet, encrypting and halting the IT-
systems of entire companies, became major problems in 2017. However, the problem of virus diffusion is not limited to computer net-
works. At the end of 2019, the world was hit by a different type of virus - SARS-CoV-2. The virus can be transmitted from person-to-person,
potentially causing a severe respiratory disease (COVID-19), and has been able to spread rapidly across all continents, bringing entire countries to a standstill.
In our final project we want to assess how viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) spread on social (and computer) networks.

For this purpose 3 synthetic network models and 3 different real world networks were invesitgated.

#### Synthetic network models
1. Barabási–Albert Graph
2. Erdős–Rényi Graph
3. Watts–Strogatz Graph

#### Real world networks
5. Facebook Friendships
6. Sex Escorts
7. Contact Tracing
